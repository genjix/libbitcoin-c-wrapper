The C API closely matches the C++ API with few minor changes.

For usage, see the provided examples.

C handlers take a void* user_data argument. Custom data can be passed by
the user into the completion handler.

All objects have create_foo() and destroy_foo(foo*) methods. This corresponds
to constructors and destructors.
